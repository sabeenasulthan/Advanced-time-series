📌 Project Title Advanced Time Series Forecasting using Deep Learning with Attention Mechanism

📖 Project Overview This project focuses on predicting future values from time-based data using Deep Learning. A synthetic time series dataset is created with trends, seasonal patterns, and noise to simulate real-world data.

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network combined with an Attention Mechanism is built using TensorFlow and Keras to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability. The model is compared with traditional baseline models like SARIMA and MLP.

🎯 Project Objectives Generate complex time series data programmatically Build an LSTM + Attention model from scratch Improve forecasting accuracy using attention Compare deep learning model with traditional baselines Evaluate performance using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE Visualize attention weights for better model understanding

🧠 Model Architecture (Simple Explanation) LSTM Layer: Learns patterns over time (trend & seasonality) Attention Layer: Helps the model focus on important past time steps Dense Layer: Produces the final forecast value

👉 Attention improves accuracy and makes the model explainable, not a black box. 🧪 Technologies & Tools Used Python TensorFlow / Keras NumPy, Pandas Matplotlib / Seaborn Scikit-learn Statsmodels (SARIMA)

📊 Evaluation Metrics Used MAE (Mean Absolute Error) RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) These metrics help measure prediction accuracy and error behavior.

🔍 Attention Visualization (Why It Matters) The attention heatmap shows which past time steps influenced the prediction most. This improves model transparency and helps users trust the predictions.

🧾 Conclusion The Attention-based LSTM model effectively captures complex temporal patterns such as trends and seasonality. Compared to traditional models, it provides better forecasting accuracy and clear interpretability, making it suitable for real-world time series application
